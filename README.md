# Churn Prediction Case Study
This was a one-day case study I participated in with a group of other students in the Galavanize Data Science Immserive program. We were given simulated user data from a ridesharing service and asked to make a model that could not only predict whether or not a customer would churn, but could also determine what factors were best at predicting rider retention.

I was in charge of creating a pipeline for data cleaning and model creation. I created a pipeline class in Python that could take in the data and try different models using sklearn. The two models we started with were logistic regression and random forest since both can give information about what features were most important in making a prediction.
